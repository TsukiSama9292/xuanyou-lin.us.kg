I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Ilan University, focusing on digital education, particularly the integration of K12 digital education games and AI (Large Language Models). Our team, consisting of five members, is developing the platform at **[k12edu](https://k12edu.us.kg)**, aimed at enhancing students' learning experiences and providing personalized educational resources through AI technology. We provide a game-based approach to promote student learning and enhance their learning experience using AI.  

My interests include DevOps and Kubernetes, operations engineering, Docker and Linux, as well as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). I am proficient in various operating systems, including Linux and Windows, and have programming skills in Python, Java, and C++.  

In the field of artificial intelligence, I specialize in LLM pre-training and fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). I utilize PyTorch for deep learning and run applications in Kubernetes environments, employing Nginx as a proxy server and load balancer, and Django as a web/API server.
